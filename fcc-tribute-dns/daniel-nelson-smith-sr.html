            <h2>A tribute to my great-grandfather, Daniel Nelson Smith Sr.</h2>

            <h5>By Michael Searle</h5>

            <p>Most of my great-grandparents passed away when I was too young to remember much about my interactions with them. Three of the four great-grandparents from my mother's side passed away years before I was born. The fourth passed away only two years after my birth. I was blessed to meet all four of the great-grandparents on my father's side of the family. Two of those great-granparents lived long enough for me to remember my interactions with them. My great-grandmother, Ellen L. (Scott) Searle, passed away when I was fourteen years old. I cherish many memories of visiting her. My parents often took us kids to her house to help with yardwork and other chores. While we were at her house she would serve us her "famous" cookies and she allowed me to work on the word search puzzles in her Modern Maturity magazines. I remember her giving us crocheted slippers each year at Christmas. I asked her to teach me how to crochet. I never did more than make a simple chain, but she was happy to teach me.</p>
                
            <p>My great-grandfather, Daniel Nelson Smith Sr. lived the longest of all my great-granparents. He passed away when I was sixteen years old. I was blessed to have a much closer association with him during the last ten years of his life. After his wife passed away he moved from his Texas home to live with his daughter, my paternal grandmother, Inez Searle. Because she came to visit us frequently I was blessed to spend time with him. It was during one of the early visits that I learned his first name wasn't Grandpa. From his many visits in our home I remember the way that his hand trembled when he spent hours, usually late at night, writing letters to his loved ones. I remember him relating seemingly fantastic stories from his life. I remember watching in amazement as he worked his craft, plumbing, when repairing plumbing in our home. He was in his late eighties at that time. I didn't think people who were eighty could do plumbing work. I remember him giving me Halls cough drops during one visit when I had a sore throat. I remember him having Whoppers to give to all of us great-grandchildren. Later, only a couple years before his death, I remember traveling, mostly driving, with my grandma and him to Alaska. It was on that trip to Alaska that I took the photo of him I used on this site. Both Grandpa Smith and I brought home pneumonia as a souvenir of that trip. While on that trip to Alaska I took many photos of spectacular scenery and wild animals. Out of all the photos I took, the only photo that I've kept all these years is the picture of my Grandpa Smith that I took when we stopped at Craters of the Moon National Monument on our way to Alaska.</p>
                
            <p>Dear Grandpa Smith, I can't wait to see you again.</p>

            <p>During August 1912 Dan married <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187220467/inez-leola-smith" target="_blank">Inez Leola Lanius</a> in a secret wedding performed by a justice of the peace in Edinburg, Texas. Why did they get married secretly? Don Searle, grandson of Dan and Inez, remembered hearing the story as a young man while sitting at the family's kitchen table. He reported:</p>
            
            <blockquote>One reason for the secret marriage was that the husband, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/170778559/william-n-montgomery" target="_blank">William N. Montgomery</a>, of Grandma's oldest sister, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/170778628/emereth-montgomery" target="_blank">Emereth Montgomery</a>, who had more or less taken over the family's affairs when her <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104083482/samuel-langley-lanius" target="_blank">father</a> died, was trying to pair Grandma up with a young man he liked. Grandma was having none of it, and if she were married, that would block any other possibilities. But her <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/170778559/william-n-montgomery" target="_blank">brother-in-law</a> dropped the idea of a marriage, so they never had to reveal their secret, and married publicly after her family was won over.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>From August 1912 - November 1913 Dan and Inez lived apart only seeing each other on weekends when Dan would travel by bus or bicycle from outside Donna, Texas to where Inez was living and teaching further up the Rio Grande Valley in a small settlement outside Los Ebanos, Texas.</p>
            
            <p>On <time datetime="11/26/1913">26 November 1913</time> Dan and Inez officially married in a public ceremony performed by a priest.</p>
            
            <p>Inez was born <time datetime="06/08/1894">8 June 1894</time> in New Era, Louisiana. She was the ninth child of <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104083482/samuel-langley-lanius" target="_blank">Samuel Langley Lanius</a> and <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80071847/josephine-lovell-lanius" target="_blank">Josephine Lovell Lanius</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Prior to marrying Dan, Inez worked as a school teacher in the upper Rio Grande Valley of Texas. She continued working as a school teacher while Dan and Inez lived apart following their secret marriage in August 1912 until their public marriage fourteen months later.</p>
            
            <p>Dan and Inez were blessed with six children, including one who was adopted. This list includes all the children and a link to each individual's Find-A-Grave page if one exists.</p>

            <h2>Notable Events In Dan's Life</h2>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1898 - 1899:</span> Having heard of the beauty of Oregon, Dan's father desired to move his family there. He sold his Singer sewing machine business and the family went to join a wagon train going west. Along the way the family stopped in Langtry, Texas. They stayed in Langtry for several weeks while father, John, dug a well for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Bean" target="_blank">Judge Roy Bean</a>. In later life Dan related his memory of meeting Judge Bean in an interview audio recorded by his grandson, Don Searle.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1899 - 1900:</span> Dan's father lands a job running the well and water pump for a division of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Alpine, Texas, which isn't too far from Langtry. The family ended up staying there, never finishing the move to Oregon. Dan grew up there until the family moved to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas about ten years later.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">Circa 1905:</span> Dan worked between school terms for the Southern Pacific Railroad. He woke the members of train crews that were sleeping in the bunkhouse so they could prepare for their upcoming run.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1906 - 1910:</span> Dan started an apprenticeship for (Mr.) Whistler in a plumbing and sheet metal shop in Alpine, Texas. Dan continued working for Whistler approximately four years until he finished his apprenticeship.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1910 - 1912:</span> At about the same time as Dan finished his apprenticeship, his father, John, who had left his job for Southern Pacific and returned to working for the oil companies in Mexico, wanted to relocate his family to Mexico. To prepare for the move, John visited the family in Alpine, sold his livestock and other possessions, and left Dan responsible for completing the sale of the family property while John returned to work in Mexico. John said he would send for the family when the time was right. When the family received the telegram they bought their train tickets and loaded the last of their belongings on the train to head to Mexico. When the train arrived in Del Rio, Texas the train conductor delivered a telegram to Dan from his father telling them to stop there due to an outbreak of yellow fever in Mexico. The family stayed in a hotel in Del Rio, Texas for 30-60 days waiting for further word from John. Instead of sending for them, John left Mexico to meet them in Del Rio. On his way there John bought property from his brother in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He moved the family there instead of Mexico. After arriving in the Rio Grande Valley, Dan found employment with Charlie Clark. Clark's company was surveying the Rio Grande Valley. Dan continued surveying and working for Charlie Clark for about four years. During that time he helped survey the towns of Donna, Pharr, and Alamo.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">2 August 1914:</span> Dan and Inez welcomed their first child, a son they named Daniel Nelson Smith Jr.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1915:</span> Dan and his older brother, Granville B. Smith, bought a sheet metal shop in McAllen, Texas. Later that year they moved their sheet metal shop into a building owned by their father in nearby Pharr, Texas. Together they provided plumbing, sheet metal, and well drilling services. At the time, business was plentiful due to strong growth in land development in that area of the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">4 July 1916:</span> Dan and Inez welcomed their second child, a daughter they name Josephine Capitola Smith</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">13 October 1917:</span> Dan and Inez welcomed their third child, Granville Beverly Smith, a son they named after Dan's older brother Granville.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">19 October 1917:</span> Dan and Inez mourned the passing of Granville B. Smith, their six day old son.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1918 - 1922:</span> Dan and Granville bought an additional plumbing and sheet metal shop in nearby Donna, Texas. Dan continued to operate the shop in Pharr while Granville operated the shop in Donna.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">6 February 1922:</span> Dan and Inez welcomed their fourth child, a daughter they named Norma Smith. Shortly thereafter they changed her name to Inez Lanius Smith</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1922:</span> Dan and Granville closed the shop in Pharr. According to Dan's memory they had too much open business on the books that they couldn't close and collect on. Subsequently, Dan and Inez moved their family to Donna where Dan operated the plumbing and sheet metal shop.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">10 December 1925:</span> John B. Smith, Dan's father passes away.</p>
    
            <p id="adopted"><span class="date-lead">Circa 1926:</span> Dan and Inez adopted a boy named Eddie Lee Cluck. Eddie was about as old as their deceased son, Granville.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">1 September 1926:</span> Despite harsh criticism, and ostracism by former friends in the community, Dan and Inez chose to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Dan reported that he found answers to his questions about life that no other church could offer him. Additionally he recounted that the stories of the people he read in the Book of Mormon directly corresponded to the stories that Dan's father, John, related from his travels in the jungles of Mexico and other central american countries.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">5 March 1929:</span> Capitola W. Smith, Dan's mother, passed away.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">21 December 1932:</span> Dan and Inez welcomed their fifth born child, a son they named Vevie Dee Smith.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">September 1939:</span> Dan and Inez left their home in Donna, Texas to relocate their family to Corpus Christi, Texas where Dan went to work at the naval base.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">Later during World War II:</span> Dan and Inez moved to Portland, Oregon where Dan worked for a defense contractor. Dan worked there for about three years. Subsequently Dan and Inez returned to Corpus Christi where they lived throughout the rest of Inez's life.</p>
    
            <p><span class="date-lead">September 1971:</span> Dan and Inez's first son, Daniel N. Smith Jr, passed away.</p>
